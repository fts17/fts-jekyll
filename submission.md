Submissions should be in PDF format in U.S. Letter size paper. They should not exceed 8 pages (all inclusive). Authors with accepted papers may purchase additional up to 4 pages. 
Submissions will be judged based on relevance, significance, originality, correctness and clarity.

Because the FTS proceedings will be published alongside the IEEE Cluster proceedings, submissions should use the same formatting as IEEE Cluster. 
Information can be found on the conference website: [IEEE Cluster 2017](https://cluster17.github.io){:target="_blank"}.
